<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Cornmeal and flour: This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour.</li>
    <li>Sugar: A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
    <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
    <li> Salt and pepper: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
    <li>Milk: A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.</li>
    <li>Egg: An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
    <li> Oil: Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil.</li>
    <li>Beef frankfurters: This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the batter by combining the dry ingredients, then stirring in the milk and egg.</li>
    <li> Skewer the frankfurters and roll in the batter.</li>
    <li>Fry the corn dogs in hot oil until lightly browned.</li>
</ol>
