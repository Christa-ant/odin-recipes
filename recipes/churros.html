    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Water: This recipe for churros starts with a cup of water.</li>
        <li>Sugar: White sugar goes into the churro dough and into the cinnamon-sugar topping.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Oil: You'll need vegetable oil for the dough and to fry the churros.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the churro dough structure.</li>
        <li>Cinnamon: The fried churros are rolled in a cinnamon-sugar mixture before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water, sugar, salt, and vegetable oil. Remove from the heat, then stir in flour.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pastry bag and pipe into strips.</li>
        <li>Fry the strips in hot oil until they're golden.</li>
        <li>Drain the churros, then roll in cinnamon-sugar.</li>
    </ol>
